## Giffy Search App

This is a Giffy Search App which brings information from Giphy's API. This App is a single page application made with ReactJS.
For the Router I used React Router Dom. For the management of the forms I used Formik with Yup.

For user management I used Firebase.
The user can register and/or log in via email.
The app allows you to search through a "Search" form. The user can also "like" the gifs and remove the "like".

Here is a [Live Demo](https://giffy-app-five.vercel.app/).
